            <p>Netflix's "Alice in Borderland" has been confirmed for a third season, following its initial announcement in September 2023. The live-action series, based on Haro Aso's manga, gained worldwide popularity, with its second season breaking viewership records. The series follows Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) and Yuzuha Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya) as they navigate a parallel universe where survival depends on winning deadly games. Season 2 concluded with them returning to the real world after defeating the Face Cards and a cliffhanger revealing the Joker card, hinting that the games may not be over. Season 3 promises new challenges and deeper exploration of themes like humanity and sacrifice.

The closer to the end seemed more and more cheesy, imo. All the flashbacks made everything drag out too much, ending was crap." Another commented, "This show is trash. I can't stand the laughable acting." </p>
